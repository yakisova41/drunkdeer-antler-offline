# DrunkDeer antler offline

DrunkDeer antler bundled into exe using Tauri

The drunkdeer web driver updated in February takes more than 30 seconds to load from JAPAN.

Even when I contacted support, they just insisted on using the beta version, and I couldn't get a solution.

I think DrunkDeer has a problem with their system of forcing customers who have paid money to use the beta version and not rolling out bug fixes promptly.
